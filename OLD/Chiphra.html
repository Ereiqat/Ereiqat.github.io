        <li>Atbash:
          <ul>
            <li>The Atbash cipher, one of the earliest encryption methods, operates by replacing each letter with its
              reverse in the alphabet.</li>
            <li>Its historical usage dates back to ancient Hebrew cryptography.</li>
            <li>Users can explore the Atbash technique on my website and understand its simplicity and security
              limitations.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Polybius:
          <ul>
            <li>The Polybius cipher employs a 5x5 grid to encode letters and numbers, making it suitable for encoding
              messages with a limited character set.</li>
            <li>It was named after the Greek historian Polybius and was used by ancient Greeks and Romans.</li>
